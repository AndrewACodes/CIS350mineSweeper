# CIS350mineSweeper

This MineSweeper project is created for GVSU CIS350 semester project. The developers for this project consist of Andrew Arent, Riley Rawlings, and Kaden Wende. This is a remake of the popular game MineSweeper. 

The game works by uncovering squares that have a chance to contain a bomb. If it doesn't contain a bomb, it will reveal the number of bombs adjacent to that uncovered square. The goal of the game is to uncover all the the squares leaving only bomb squares left. 

This game runs on java which means it will be able to run on any operating system! Windows, Mac, any Linux distribution, doesn't matter it will be able to run. (The game may have different style based on operating system, but overall gameplay will be accurate and the same.)

## Upcoming Features
- **Flagging Squares.** Being able to mark squares to flag them. This would allow the user a piece of mind and make the game not so tedious when remembering where strategically deduced bombs have been located.


- **Timer.** A timer would allow for some type of urgency and thrill when playing. We'd also allow a customizeable timer for the laid back players who may be busy while playing and will take longer to complete each puzzle.


- **Difficulties.** Having multiple difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard, Impossible) would allow the game to be customizeable to different skill level players. The same difficulty may get repetitive. Multiple difficulties would give the user something to progress towards and a skill they can learn and improve on.


- **Customizeable environments.** The user will be able to change what the board looks like. (Dark mode, etc.) This would allow the user to feel more comfortable depending on the environment they are in (low light). It would also allow the user to feel more connected to the game when able to change the colors to exactly what they want.

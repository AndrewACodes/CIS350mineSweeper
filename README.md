# CIS350mineSweeper

This MineSweeper project is created for GVSU CIS350 semester project. The developers for this project consist of Andrew Arent, Riley Rawlings, and Kaden Wende. This is a remake of the popular game MineSweeper. 

The game works by uncovering squares that have a chance to contain a bomb. If it doesn't contain a bomb, it will reveal the number of bombs adjacent to that uncovered square. The goal of the game is to uncover all the the squares leaving only bomb squares left. 

This game runs on java which means it will be able to run on any operating system! Windows, Mac, any Linux distribution, doesn't matter it will be able to run. (The game may have different style based on operating system, but overall gameplay will be accurate and the same.)

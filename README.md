# CIS350mineSweeper

This MineSweeper project is created for GVSU CIS350 semester project. The developers for this project consist of Andrew Arent, Riley Rawlings, and Kaden Wende. This is a remake of the popular game MineSweeper. The game works by uncovering squares that have a chance to contain a bomb. If it doesn't contain a bomb, it will reveal the number of bombs adjacent to that uncovered square. The goal of the game is to uncover all the the squares leaving only bomb squares left.
